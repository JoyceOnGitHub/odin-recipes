        <h1>Deli-Inspired Bacon, Egg, and Cheese</h1>

        <p>I live next to a deli. They make an assortment of sandwiches but this one in particular always strikes as so delicious every time I bite into it. I practically grew up eating this out of deli’s across my high school years.</p>
        <p>Now that I’m an adult, I say screw that!  I can make one at home that can be made quick in the morning!</p>
        <p>You’re gonna want really good bacon for this recipe. I prefer using Jimmy Dean’s hickory smoked bacon. Avoid using bacon brands like Oscar Mayer, their bacon is quite lacking in texture and flavor. The better the quality the more flavor and texture you can get out of this recipe.</p>
        <p>The first 3 steps could be done in a toaster oven if you’d like, or if you don’t want any butter then avoid the first 3 steps. Still make sure your bread is cut in half horizontally.</p>
