            <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>MSG (monosodium glutamate)</li>
            <li>Leftover(or fresh) rice</li>
            <li>1-2 Eggs</li>
            <li>Chives or green onions (both optional)</li>
            <li>Goya adobo seasoning (Optional, you can use your seasoning of choice on meat)</li>

        <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick any meat of your choice to cook. I preferably enjoy using steak but chicken and pork work really well too! Before you cook your meat, cut it into small cube-like chunks. These chunks will mix with rice really well.</li>
            <li>Pour some oil into your pan and let your oil heat up on a medium flame.</li>
            <li>Once ready, pour your chunks in, sprinkle some adobo seasoning or your seasoning of choice.</li>
            <li>Let the meat cook till done.</li>
            <li>Grab another plate and remove the cooked chunks of meat off the pan.</li>
            <li>Now add butter to the pan and let it heat up.</li>
            <li>Crack 1-2 eggs and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Move the eggs around, you want them scrambled.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to a medium, leave the eggs in the pan and pour in your rice.</li>
            <li>Move it around and work it.</li>
            <li>The rice is warming up now, go on and add a quick pour of toasted sesame oil, about ½ tablespoon.</li>
            <li>Move it around and then sprinkle a little bit of soy sauce around the rice. (Note: Too much soy sauce can make it very salty so be conservative with it.)</li>
            <li>Taste the rice, it should be hot but not tongue-burning hot.</li>
            <li>Now add in your chunks of meat, move it around.</li>
            <li>You can turn off the flame and add a dash or two of MSG.</li>
            <li>Once more, move it around.</li>
            <li>You can plate it and optionally sprinkle some chives or green onions on top!</li>
            <li>You’re done! Now sit back and enjoy that chaufa!</li>
        </ol>
