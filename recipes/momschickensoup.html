        <p>This recipe is based off my mother's take on chicken noodle soup. This requires no canned broth or stock.</p>
        <p>It's a delicous, simple, and fresh soup that'll pick you up even in the <strong>coldest</strong> and <strong>roughest</strong> of days.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Carrots</li>
            <li>2-3 Stalks of celery</li>
            <li>1/4 of Yellow squash</li>
            <li>Whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 Chicken bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1 Cup of noodles of choice</li>
            <li>Goya adobo Seasoning</li>
            <li>2-3 Stalks of fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>2-3 Stalks of fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 Spoonful of oregano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with cutting your chicken into seperate pieces, optionally wash your chicken.</li>
            <li>Fill a pot halfway with cold water, you'd want enough to cover the chicken but not too much to where it fills to the brim.</li>
            <li>Once your water is boiling add the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Add one cube of chicken bouillon.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and let the pot boil for about 45 minutes, the chicken after that time should be cooked well.</li>
            <li>During that time, cut up your carrots, celery, and squash.</li>
            <li>Near the end of the chicken cook time, add adobo seasoning. Season to taste.</li>
            <li>After the 45 minutes, add your cut vegetables. Let the pot boil for 15-20 more minutes. You want your vegetables to feel tender after this time.</li>
            <li>Add your choice of pasta once vegetables are done. Pasta cook time could vary depending on your choice of pasta. Check pasta's packaging for more information. Another option is also checking in every 10 or so minutes to see when the pasta is ready.</li>
            <li>Finally, onces everything is cooked. Top with your cut parsley, cilantro, and a spoonful of oregano sprinkled throughout.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
